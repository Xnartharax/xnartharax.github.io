There are tons of libraries and frameworks to help you build your NN models. They abstract the relatively complex math to simple building blocks making them easier to use. Additionally Tensorflow, PyTorch and Co. also offer GPU acceleration without which modern Deep Learning would not be possible.  
In this series I want to take a look behind the scenes. How does the math work and how to implement it? Really understanding neural networks takes more than understanding the the frameworks.
